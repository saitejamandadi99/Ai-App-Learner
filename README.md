## 💡 How It Works

1. User logs in or registers via the frontend.
2. After authentication, user lands on the planner page.
3. Enter a topic and submit.
4. Frontend sends a POST request to the backend.
5. Backend uses Gemini AI API to generate a structured lesson plan.
6. The plan is returned to the frontend and saved in MongoDB.
7. Users can view or download past plans from the History page.

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Frontend:** Hosted on Render — built with `npm run build`, deployed from `build/` directory.
- **Backend:** Also on Render — connected to MongoDB Atlas for persistent data.

## 📈 Performance & Optimization

- Initial cold start times on Render may cause a 5–10s delay on first load.
- Localhost is faster—no cold boot required.
- Future enhancements:
  - Caching frequently requested lesson plans
  - Migrating to a dedicated VPS or Vercel for faster cold starts
  - Adding loading skeletons for better UX

---

## 🎯 Future Scope
- 🔄 Improve download/export features (PDF, Markdown).
- 📊 Analytics for generated content.
- 🧑‍🏫 Educator dashboard with save/share templates.
- 🔔 Notifications for login and register and content generation
